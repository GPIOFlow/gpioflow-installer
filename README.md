Web-based GPIO and PWM control for Raspberry Pi with image-based buttons, manual triggers, timers and intervals
**# GpioFlow

🚀 **Web-based GPIO & PWM control software for Raspberry Pi with a dynamic, configurable frontend.**

---

## 🔌 What is GpioFlow?

**GpioFlow** is a commercial software solution that allows you to control Raspberry Pi GPIO and PWM pins through a modern, web-based user interface — **no programming required**.

Create interactive control panels using buttons and images, define GPIO actions, and automate timed pin behavior with just a few clicks.

> **Note:** GpioFlow was previously known as **ActionPanel**.  
> The product has been renamed and is now continued as **GpioFlow**.

## ❓ The Problem

Controlling GPIO pins typically requires:

- Writing custom scripts
- Technical knowledge
- Hard-coded user interfaces
- Manual changes for every new setup

This makes rapid prototyping and user-friendly control difficult.

---

## ✅ The Solution

GpioFlow solves this by providing:

- A configurable web-based frontend
- Visual button and image-based controls
- Dynamic GPIO-to-action mapping
- Timed GPIO & PWM activation per interaction
- Clean frontend / backend separation

All configuration is done **without touching the code**.
